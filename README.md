<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Pedro Figueroa</h1>
<h3 align="left">A Wordpress Oriented Website Developer from Argentina</h3>

<p>Curious and restless; these are the words that describe me the best.<br>

Since 2009 I've worked as a WordPress Web Developer, I've taken part in different environmental organizations, and I've even had time to study Foreign Trade and languages (English and German, especially).<br>

I love geography, astronomy, and philosophy; but my true passion is non-profit organizations. I collaborate with them offering volunteering and free web development.<br>

-- If you are part of an NGO do not hesitate to contact me in case you need assistance. -- </p>
